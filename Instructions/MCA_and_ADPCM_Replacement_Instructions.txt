Requirements

    Kuriimu2
    extracted MHGU /romfs/nativeNX/...
    A copy of Handburger Modkit - Ifrit

    1. Scan and locate the .mca/.adpcm file you want to replace. Many .mca and .adpcm are hidden with .arc files that will be discussed in further instructions.

    2. Run Kuriimu2 and navigate to the desired .arc file and click on MT Arc as your plugin.

    3. Extract the .arc file, and remember to save it.

    4. Pinpoint which .mca/.adpcm you wish to replace. In my case I will be replacing f01_00.mca which was in /romfs/nativeNX/arc/player/com/f/vo/01.arc/sound/se/pl/vo/f01/wav/f01.00.mca.

    5. Acquire your replacement wav and adjust the volume if necessary.

    6. Place the audio file onto HBMK-IFRIT's AudioConverter.bat, where it will convert your wav into a .adpcm. If your file that you want to replace is called a .adpcm, then rename it as such. Same goes for .mca.

    7. Re-open Kuriimu2 and open your 01.arc again. Right click the folder and click replace with the desired changed files nested inside.

    8. Create a directory that mimics the old one for where you place your new modified .arc file. in my case it would be ~/arc/player/com/f/vo/01.arc

    9. Move this romfs directory that you created and place it into your emulator/modded Switch. 

9a. if you are using Yuzu, make a folder called VoiceMod or whatever you like and place your romfs folder into it. Then right click on MHGU and click Open Mod Data Location. Place your folder there. 

9b. If you are using Ryujinx, rightclick on MHGU and select Mod Directory and drop the romfs file 

9c. If you are using a modded Switch, navigate to Atmosphere > contents > 0100770008dd8000 and drop the romfs file there.
    
    10. And if you did all that, you should have the mod working!
